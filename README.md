# SGBD-Oracle

This has been my journey so far learning PL/SQL.  
I've been studying this language for the whole semester, every week learning a new concept and applying my knowledge by creating exercises on the database that I created for this project.
  
The main concepts learned and used:  

-> Variables
-> Cursors  
-> Exceptions  
-> Procedures  
-> Functions  
-> Packages  
-> Triggers
